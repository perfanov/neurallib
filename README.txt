neurallib is is a practice project for making a very limited framework for neural network design, testing and evaluation.

The focus of the practice is to maintain and develop my style in:
- organic design
- low-level ml and math
- generics and other c++ candy
- unit and functional testing
- git workflow

The original goal is to successfully use this built framework to recreate a simple backprop network, like AlexNet on MNIST, and get good/expected results.
